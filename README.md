**Face Recognition & Attendance System** <br>
This project is a Face Recognition & Attendance System developed in PyCharm using Python, OpenCV, NumPy, LBPH Algorithm, and MySQL. The system offers two main options on the main page: "Students" and "Admin".

* **Students:** Allows students to mark their attendance.
* **Admin:** Provides access to admin functionalities including managing student details, training data, viewing photos, and exiting the system.
